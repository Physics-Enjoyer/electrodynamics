# Classical Electrodynamics

<!--- TODO: add references section and include a formula sheet -->
Here are my notes for undergraduate classical electrodynamics. This course uses as its primary textbook Introduction to Electrodynamics (*Fourth Edition*) by David J. Griffiths and Engineering Electromagnetics (*Third Edition*) by Nathan Ida.

As with all my notes these will be converted from hand written notes into a format suitable for computational work using Jupyter Notebooks. This is one of the first classes I am taking while trying to keep my notes updated in Jupyter Notebooks so I'm still figuring out much of how I want to write and convert these notes. 

In addition to my class notes there is also a web and mobile friendly version of David J. Griffiths Introduction to Electrodynamics Fourth Edition. This is a nearly complete copy of the notes by [PeppyHare](https://github.com/PeppyHare/r) on GitHub but instead of using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) I am using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org). Some of the elements of the original notes were not working well on PeppyHare's site so I am simply updating some of the formatting. There are still some issues with the web version of the book that I need to figure out but its mostly complete.


## Before we begin

These notes will mostly be written in Jupyter Notebooks and then converted to HTML by the [jupyter {book}](https://jupyterbook.org) project. The notes comprise of several Jupyter Notebooks so the second cell in each notebook will include the imports. Generally I will hide these cells from view with a dropdown box.
